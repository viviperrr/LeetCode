## 938. Range Sum of BST

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-bst/

**Description**
Given the root node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all nodes with value between L and R (inclusive).

The binary search tree is guaranteed to have unique values.

**For example:**
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], L = 7, R = 15
Output: 32
Example 2:

Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], L = 6, R = 10
Output: 23

**Result**
return [2].

**Note:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is at most 10000.
- The final answer is guaranteed to be less than 2^31.
